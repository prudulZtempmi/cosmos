## What is Taijiquan?
  
Taijiquan is a Chinese word that can be translated as "Grand Ultimate Fist" or "Supreme Ultimate Boxing". It is derived from the concept of Taiji, which represents the harmony and balance of the opposing forces of Yin and Yang in the universe. Taijiquan is an internal martial art, which means that it focuses on cultivating and manipulating the internal energy or Qi (pronounced "chee") that flows through the body.
  
Taijiquan was developed in China over several centuries, influenced by various schools of philosophy, medicine, and martial arts. The origin of Taijiquan is shrouded in mystery and legend, but one of the most widely accepted theories is that it was created by Zhang Sanfeng, a Taoist monk who lived in the 12th or 13th century. Zhang Sanfeng allegedly witnessed a fight between a snake and a crane, and was inspired by their movements and strategies to create a new martial art that combined softness and hardness, yielding and striking, circularity and linearity.
  
The most popular style of Taijiquan today is the Yang style, which was founded by Yang Lu-Chan (1799-1872), who learned Taijiquan from Chen Chang-Xing, a master of the Chen style. Yang Lu-Chan modified and simplified the Chen style to suit his own preferences and abilities, and taught it to many students in Beijing. One of his sons, Yang Ban-Hou (1837-1892), was considered to be his most skilled successor, who inherited his father's original teachings and secrets. Yang Ban-Hou taught his version of Taijiquan to several disciples, including Wu Yu-Xiang (1812-1880), who later created his own style known as Wu (Hao) style.
  
## What are the 37 Postures?
  
The 37-postures form is a short and compact version of the Yang style Taijiquan form, which consists of 108 movements. The 37-postures form was created by Cheng Man-Ching (1901-1975), a famous master of Taijiquan, Chinese medicine, painting, calligraphy, and poetry. Cheng Man-Ching learned Taijiquan from Yang Cheng-Fu (1883-1936), the grandson of Yang Lu-Chan and the third generation leader of the Yang style. Cheng Man-Ching modified and simplified the Yang style form to make it more accessible and suitable for modern people.
  
The 37-postures form is also known as the Simplified Form or the Short Form. It contains all the essential elements and principles of Taijiquan, but eliminates some repetitions and transitions. The 37-postures form can be performed in about 10 minutes, depending on the speed and rhythm. The names of the 37 postures are as follows:
  
1. Commencing Form
2. Grasp Sparrow's Tail - Ward Off Left
3. Grasp Sparrow's Tail - Ward Off Right
4. Grasp Sparrow's Tail - Roll Back
5. Grasp Sparrow's Tail - Press
