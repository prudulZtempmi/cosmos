# Introduction to Heat Transfer, 5th Edition by Incropera, DeWitt, Bergman and Lavine
 
Heat transfer is the process of energy transfer due to temperature difference. It is a fundamental subject in engineering and applied sciences that has many applications in various fields such as aerospace, mechanical, chemical, biomedical and environmental engineering. Understanding the principles and methods of heat transfer is essential for designing and analyzing systems that involve heat exchange, such as heat exchangers, refrigerators, air conditioners, turbines, engines, solar panels and more.
 
Introduction to Heat Transfer, 5th Edition by Incropera, DeWitt, Bergman and Lavine is a comprehensive textbook that covers the theory and practice of heat transfer in a clear and rigorous manner. It provides students with a solid foundation of the basic modes of heat transfer: conduction, convection and radiation. It also introduces the concepts of heat generation, heat transfer coefficients, thermal resistance networks, heat sources and sinks, transient heat conduction, external and internal forced convection, natural convection, boiling and condensation, heat exchangers, radiation exchange between surfaces, radiation from gases and participating media, and more. The book includes numerous examples and problems that illustrate the application of heat transfer principles to real-world situations.
