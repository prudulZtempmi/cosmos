The book is divided into four parts: The Art of Loving, The Art of Thinking, The Art of Working and The Art of Growing Old. In each part, Maurois explores the challenges and opportunities that each stage of life presents, and how to cope with them gracefully and creatively. He also discusses the role of culture, education, religion and morality in shaping one's character and worldview.
 
Maurois writes in a clear, elegant and engaging style, with a touch of humor and irony. He does not pretend to have all the answers, but rather invites the reader to reflect on their own values and choices. He also shows a great respect for human diversity and individuality, and does not impose a rigid or dogmatic system of rules or principles. He acknowledges the complexity and uncertainty of life, but also its beauty and joy.
 
Un Arte De Vivir is a book that can inspire and enlighten anyone who wants to improve themselves and their relationships with others. It is a book that can help one to find meaning and purpose in life, and to appreciate its precious moments. It is a book that can teach one how to be an artist of living.
  
One of the main themes of the book is the art of loving, which Maurois considers as the foundation of happiness and harmony. He explores the different forms and expressions of love, such as romantic love, marital love, parental love, filial love and friendship. He also analyzes the obstacles and pitfalls that can threaten love, such as jealousy, boredom, infidelity and divorce. He advises the reader to cultivate a balance between passion and reason, between selflessness and self-respect, between loyalty and freedom.
 
Maurois writes: "Love is not a state of the soul, but a mode of action. It is not enough to feel it; one must practice it. Love is an art that requires patience, skill and generosity. It is also an art that can be learned and improved. The first condition for loving well is to know oneself well. The second is to know the other well. The third is to respect the differences and complementarities that exist between two beings."
 
Another theme of the book is the art of thinking, which Maurois considers as the source of wisdom and creativity. He explores the different ways of thinking, such as intuition, imagination, logic and criticism. He also examines the role of culture, education, religion and morality in shaping one's mind and worldview. He advises the reader to develop a curious and open mind, to seek truth and beauty, to avoid dogmatism and fanaticism, to embrace diversity and tolerance.
 
Maurois writes: "Thinking is not a passive or mechanical activity; it is an active and creative one. It is not enough to receive information; one must process it, interpret it, question it, relate it to other knowledge. Thinking is an art that requires courage, curiosity and humility. It is also an art that can be cultivated and enriched. The first condition for thinking well is to have a clear and organized mind. The second is to have a broad and varied culture. The third is to have a critical and independent spirit."
