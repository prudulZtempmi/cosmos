How does Ext Reb Tool v 1.03.20 compare to other plugins? As mentioned earlier, this plugin is based on WP Rocket, which is one of the most popular and trusted plugins for WordPress optimization. However, Ext Reb Tool v 1.03.20 offers some extra features and options that WP Rocket does not have, such as custom compression level and cache expiration time, option to preload fonts and critical CSS, option to export and import settings, and more.
 
However, Ext Reb Tool v 1.03.20 is not a replacement for WP Rocket, but rather a complement or alternative for users who want more control and flexibility over their site's optimization. WP Rocket is still a great plugin for beginners and intermediate users who want a simple and effective solution for their site's performance.
